### Step 1: Set Up Azure Virtual Machines
1. **Create Virtual Machines**:
    - Windows 10 Pro
    - Ubuntu
    - Windows 11
2. **Configure Network Settings**:
    - Assign static IPs if necessary
    - Set up Network Security Groups (NSGs)

### Step 2: Install Necessary Tools
1. **On Windows VMs**:
    - Install Wireshark
    - necessary command-line tools (e.g., PowerShell, Command Prompt)
2. **On Ubuntu VMs**:
    -ping ip

   ### Step 3: Configure Remote Desktop
- Ensure Remote Desktop is enabled on all Windows VMs.

- Set up SSH access for Ubuntu VM.
  
### Step 4: Experiment with Network Traffic
1. **Capture Network Traffic with Wireshark**:

    - Start capturing traffic on each VM.
    - Generate traffic using various protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP).

3. **Test Traffic**:
    - Test connectivity with different NSG rules.


Summary

 This lab successfully met its objectives of observing network traffic and experimenting with security configurations. The hands-on experience I gained through this project is invaluable for deepening my understanding of network protocols and cybersecurity measures in a cloud environment. By documenting the process and findings, this lab also serves as a useful reference for future projects and learning.

Overall, this lab project underscores the critical role of network traffic analysis and security configurations in maintaining secure and efficient cloud-based environments.
